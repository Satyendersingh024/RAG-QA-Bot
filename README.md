RAG-Based QA Bot
Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA bot project. This tool allows users to upload documents, ask questions about the document's content, and receive real-time answers. It's designed to help users retrieve relevant information from their uploaded documents through a friendly and interactive interface.

Key Features
Interactive Interface: Users can upload PDF documents and ask questions directly.
Real-Time Answers: The system retrieves relevant sections of the document and provides accurate responses in real-time.
Document Embedding: The bot processes documents and stores information in a format that enables quick and relevant data retrieval.
Generative Responses: The bot provides answers using a generative language model, ensuring that responses are contextually accurate.
How It Works
Upload Document: You start by uploading a PDF file through the botâ€™s interface.
Ask a Question: After uploading the document, you can type your question in the input box, and the bot will process the document.
View the Response: The bot retrieves relevant document sections and generates an answer based on the content, which will be displayed to you alongside the referenced sections.
Setting Up the Bot
To use the bot locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Download the project from GitHub to your local system.
Install Required Dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary tools to run the project.
Configure API Keys: You need API keys for document embeddings and answer generation.
Run the Application: Start the bot and use the web interface to interact with it.
Using the Bot
Step 1: Upload a PDF document via the upload button.
Step 2: Enter your query about the document into the provided question box.
Step 3: View the generated answer and the retrieved document segments that were used to formulate the response.
Project Components
Frontend: A simple interface allowing users to upload files and ask questions.
Backend: Processes documents, stores embeddings, and retrieves information based on queries.
Deployment
You can deploy the bot using Docker or any cloud platform. The system is containerized to ensure easy and consistent deployment. Once deployed, the bot will be accessible via a web interface.

Example Use Case
Upload: A user uploads a research paper.
Query: The user asks, "What were the main findings of the study?"
Response: The bot retrieves the relevant sections from the document and provides a concise answer.
Future Improvements
Support for more document types (e.g., DOCX, TXT).
Enhanced query handling to provide more accurate and nuanced responses.
Performance optimization for handling larger documents and more complex queries efficiently.
Contribution
If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to submit issues or make pull requests via GitHub.

By following this README, users should be able to set up and interact with the RAG-based QA bot easily and understand how to upload documents and ask questions.
